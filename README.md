# Sticky Notes Project

This project is a simple implementation of a "Sticky Notes" application where users can create colorful sticky notes and delete them as needed. It features a text box and a color picker for adjusting the note's color. 

## Features

- Users can enter text into the text box.
- Users can choose a background color for the sticky note using the color picker.
- Clicking the "Add Note" button creates a new sticky note with the entered text and selected background color.
- Each sticky note has a delete button, allowing users to remove the note from the screen.
